# Chatsky UI overview

Chatsky UI is a web application for creating highly customizable chatbots. This app is based on step-by-step design of the dialog flow, where you define each bot response and predict what the end user may reply. The result is a dialog graph in which all dialog variants are specified. You can assign bot responses and possible user reactions in a variety of ways: direct quotes, simplified intent-based constructions, LLM prompts, and Python code.

To make your bot more personalized, you can also define slots - pieces of information about a user that can be utilized in a conversation, such as the person's name, phone number or email, as well as data relevant to the conversation, such as their favorite hobby or a product they're interested in.

For further convenience and versatility, you can import vocabularies, create your own code snippets and small parts of a dialog flow which will be available in the dedicated library, right at your fingertips.

Flexible settings also allow you to customize the bot for your needs. You can configure the pipeline in which you can connect additional dialog context processing services, add presets for building the bot after its configuration, and connect third-party LLM services for processing prompts.

If you do not want to manually enter all the branches of the dialog, you can import or create your own dialog samples, based on which the program will build a dialog graph. All you have to do now is configure the bot for optimal performance.

After you have created, built and run your bot, you can chat with it in the internal dialog interface or directly in a messenger, and the logs of the build, run and additional tests will help you understand where the error could occur.

Quick build and run option is also currently located at the top bar of Edit screen. This is a temporary solution before Deliver tab is released.

#### Deliver

Deliver tab allows you to set up your bot’s build and run configurations. After the bot is run, you will be able to test it in the internal chat panel or launch it to messengers.

_Read more about build & run._
